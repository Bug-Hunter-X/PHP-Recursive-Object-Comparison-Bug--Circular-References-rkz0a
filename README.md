This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in PHP when recursively comparing objects: handling circular references.  The provided code implements a recursive object comparison function. However, this function fails when encountering objects with circular references, potentially leading to infinite recursion and crashes.  The solution shows how to effectively address this issue.
